# Digit Recognition App
This is an experimental app for my super simple digit recognition Python script. It uses Winforms and C# to create the UI and Python to perform inference. This app is an experiment for me to learn C# and .NET and should probably not be used by anyone else.

## Usage
* Ensure the required packages are installed
* Put the image in the DigitRecognition folder
* Update the path to Python and the image in Model.cs

## Required Packages:
* opencv-python
* pytorch
* numpy
* Pillow
